<!-- see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization for more information -->
  - Use the Angular CLI to generate components, services, and other artifacts.
  - Use Jasmine for unit testing and Protractor for end-to-end testing.
  - Use TestBed to configure and create an Angular testing module.
  - Use async/await for asynchronous tests.
  - Use spies to mock dependencies and track function calls.
  - Use the `fakeAsync` and `tick` functions for testing asynchronous code.
  - Use the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` functions to set up and tear down tests.
  - Use the `it` function to define individual test cases.
  - Use the `describe` function to group related test cases.
  - write "test code generated by AI" at the end of the test file.
